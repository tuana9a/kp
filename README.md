- converting worker to control plane or in reverse is not straight forward, as `kubeadm reset` leave cni (network), iptables behind so instead of modifing the node just remove it and create a new one.
- when upgrading the k8s, upgrade in-place for worker node is not a must, we can just drain it, remove it, destroy it then create a new one with installed newer k8s verion.
